# Principal-Component-Analysis
The project focuses on dimensionality reduction and classification of the Breast Cancer dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) along with appropriate classification algorithms. The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, and the task is to predict whether the mass is benign or malignant.
